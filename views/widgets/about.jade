        We want more people to look back and thank their teachers; they put a lot of energy into helping us get to where we are today. We are a team of 6 students. As part of our senior project, we created an app that allows anyone to send a thank you note to a past teacher. We even take care of sending it for you. Take a look around our site and fill out a thank you note!
